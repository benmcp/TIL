# RUN vs CMD

`RUN` executes command(s) in a new layer and creates a new image. E.g., it is often used for installing software packages.
`CMD` sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs.
`ENTRYPOINT` configures a container that will run as an executable.
