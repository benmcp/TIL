# ES2015 - Introduction 

TLDR- ES = ECMAScript, ECMAScript version 6 was released in 2015.

## What is ES2015

The best way to understand what ES2015 is, is to work backwards and start from the begining.

ECMAScript is essentially a standard for a scripting language which is overseen by Ecma International. Ecma International is an internal standards organisation founded in 1961 as a means to normalise Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Consumer Electronics (CE).

## Why do you mainly hear about it with javascript? 

Again, a bit of history.

In the mid 1990's, when web browsers were being created into the form we are familar with today, there was a requirement for a scripting language that could run on the client side. The idea was to create a lightweight language that could run small applications on the client side.

Originally named Mocha, this language was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich and bundled in Netscape Navigator 2.0's beta release in September 1995 as LiveScript. The language was rebranded as JavaScript, an action that has been seem as a marketing tactic to leverage off the name of the then popular Java language.

As a means to ensue Javascript's future against Microsoft's rival client side scripting language JScript, Netscape submitted the scripting language to Ecma International. This resulted in Ecma International's standardised scripting language, EMCAScript.

Since then, Ecma International have provided specifications for ECMAScript, which Javascript has closely followed.

## How does ECMAScript relate to ES2015?

Since June 1997, there have been six (6) editions of ECMAScript published by Ecma International, with the 6th edition (ES6), being the latest in 2015.

The issue is, ES6 will encompass all the versions of ES6, i.e. 6.01, 6.1, 6.17 etc which can become confusing. As a means to provide greater clarity/versioning discrimination, there was been a growing movement towards defining versions of ECMAScript in year increments.
