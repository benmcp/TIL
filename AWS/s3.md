## Upload to S3 via AWS CLI
```
aws s3 cp RANDOM.FILE s3://YOUR-BUCKET/NEW-RANDOM-FILE.NAME
```

## Copy files across between AWS Accounts

Every now and again a task may arise where files and directories need to be moved between s3 buckets in different accounts. Below is an overview of how to move files from SOURCE_BUCKET in SOURCE_ACCOUNT to TARGET_BUCKET in TARGET_ACCOUNT.


1. In the AWS Console, go to the SOURCE_BUCKET in the SOURCE_ACCOUNT

2. Go to Permissions then Bucket Policy and add the following policy, noting to replace TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID and SOURCE_BUCKET
```
[
    {
        "Sid": "DelegateS3Access",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": [
                "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT:root"
            ]
        },
        "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
            "s3:GetObjectTagging"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::SOURCE_BUCKET/*",
            "arn:aws:s3:::SOURCE_BUCKET"
        ]
    }
]
```
 

3. Next, in the CLI run the following commands
```
aws s3 sync \
  s3://SOURCE_BUCKET/SOURCE_DIRECTORY \
  s3://TARGET_BUCKET/TARGET_DIRECTORY/
  --profile TARGET_PROFILE
```

4. Sit back and wait for all the files to be copied across

## Simple Optional/additional routing for Static Site hosting

```
  <RoutingRules>
    <RoutingRule>
      <Condition>
        <KeyPrefixEquals>some/huge/link</KeyPrefixEquals>
      </Condition>
      <Redirect>
        <ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>smallerlink</ReplaceKeyPrefixWith>
      </Redirect>
    </RoutingRule>
  </RoutingRules>
  ```
