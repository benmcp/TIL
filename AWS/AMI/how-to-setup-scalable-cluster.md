# How to setup a scalable cluster on AWS

Over the past several months I've been working with a lot of AWS. Because of this I've become increasingly familar with various aspects of AWS. This is an attempt to solidify my learnings and create a secure cluster to host a site. I'm currently working/writing this on a Mac OS.

## Conents

1. Setup AMI
2. Kubernetes to control container orchestration
3. Docker to manage the containers
4. CodeBuild/CodeDeploy/CodePiepline for CD/CI
5. Jenkins to run the build/checks
6. Sit within own unique VPN

This is a lot of content/work so lets begin. (alternatively you could just use a 3rd party to automate this entire process but where's the fun in that!)
